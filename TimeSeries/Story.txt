For the past five years, I’d devoted all of my free time to learning as much
as I possibly could about James Halliday.
I’d exhaustively studied his life,
accomplishments, and interests.
Over a dozen different Halliday biographies had been published in the years since his death, and I’d read them all. Several
documentary films had also been made about him, and I’d studied those, too.
I’d studied every word Halliday had ever written, and I’d played every
videogame he’d ever made.
I took notes, writing down every detail I thought
might be related to the Hunt.
I kept everything in a notebook (which I’d
started to call my “grail diary” after watching the third Indiana Jones film).For the past five years, I’d devoted all of my free time to learning as much
